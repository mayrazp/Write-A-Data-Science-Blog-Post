# Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in exploring the Airbnb dataset from Canada to better understand the following questions:

1. What we can say about customerâ€™s feelings in the reviews posted after staying in an Airbnb Canada house/apartment?.
2. What is the sentiment analysis of customer review grouped by neighborhood?
3. Which categories, such as person names, organizations, locations, monetary values, percentages, time expressions were mentioned in the reviews?

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
